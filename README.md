## **3/. Executive Summary.**

In 2020, Adidas faced a significant downturn due to the severe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and a lack of adequate preparedness, resulting in a notably weak performance. However, from 2021 onward, as effective measures were implemented and the U.S. economy began to recover, Adidas' business in the region also rebounded.
- Revenue in 2021 surged by **294%** compared to 2020.
- Units sold increased by **336%**, reflecting strong market demand.
- Profit rose by **324%**, driving the profit margin up from **35%** in 2020 to **37%** in 2021.

Adidas has effectively managed its costs, **maintaining a stable and improving profit margin** since overcoming the initial disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. However, as the company focuses on **post-pandemic recovery**, the priority shifts towards sales growth, customer expansion, and market share development, rather than immediate cost optimization.

This analysis aims to identify key drivers behind Adidas‚Äô **3-4x revenue recovery post-pandemic**. While the economic rebound played a role, **the company's performance was significantly influenced by retailers, regional dynamics, and sales methods**.

## **4/. Insight Deep-Dive.**

### **4.1/. Sales & Profit trends**

In 2020, Adidas experienced a significant decline in business performance due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, by 2021, as the economy began to recover, Adidas successfully rebounded, with monthly revenue increasing 3-4 times compared to 2020. This sharp contrast highlights the profound effect of the pandemic on the company's operations. The key question remains: **What strategic measures did Adidas implement to drive this strong recovery?**

In 2020, consumer spending in the U.S. hit a low point due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the pandemic remained severe in 2021, the economy began to recover. This external factor was the primary driver influencing Adidas' business performance in the U.S. market during this period.

### **4.2/. Product Level Performance.**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0424d60-7cfb-4f9c-af61-6db85e9242ce)

Almost all product lines experienced significant growth post-pandemic, with revenue increasing by **294%** and units sold rising by **336%** compared to 2020. However, **the profit margin remained relatively stable at 37%**, suggesting that while sales volume and revenue surged, the growth was driven more by external factors such as market recovery and consumer demand rather than changes in product offerings.

Product performance fluctuated significantly under the impact of the pandemic. However, by 2021, sales distribution across product lines became more balanced. This suggests that **Adidas did not pursue a focused product development strategy targeting specific categories or customer segments** but instead experienced a broad-based recovery.

### **4.3/. Sale Methods Level Performance**

The pandemic posed significant challenges but also created opportunities for Adidas‚Äô online business to thrive. In 2020, **online sales** accounted for only **2%** of total revenue. However, by 2021, it had become the **second-largest revenue stream** and the leading sales channel by volume. While in-store and outlet sales rebounded post-pandemic, online sales saw an extraordinary surge, growing by **5280%** in revenue and 878% in units sold. This rapid growth in e-commerce was a key driver in Adidas‚Äô post-pandemic recovery.

### **4.4/. Retailers Comparisons**

A key factor contributing to Adidas‚Äô post-pandemic recovery was **expanding its retailer network and strengthening partnerships**.

In 2021, **Amazon and Kohl‚Äôs emerged as two new retail partners**, significantly boosting overall sales. **Amazon contributed over 10% of total revenue**, while **Kohl‚Äôs accounted for 14%**, reflecting their strong consumer reach and Adidas‚Äô successful market penetration through these channels.

Additionally, **Sports Direct experienced remarkable growth**, with revenue and units sold increasing by more than 10 times compared to 2020. This underscores Adidas‚Äô ability to capitalize on high-performing retailers to drive recovery.

In contrast, **Walmart and West Gear saw modest growth**, with revenue increasing by **27%** and **69%**, respectively, suggesting that these retailers played a relatively smaller role in Adidas‚Äô post-pandemic resurgence.

This data highlights how **strategic retail partnerships** played a crucial role in Adidas' recovery, with Amazon, Kohl‚Äôs, and Sports Direct driving the most significant impact.

### **4.5/. Regional Comparisons**

Alongside the expansion of Adidas' retail network, the distribution of revenue across different regions also became more balanced in 2021.

The Midwest region saw an exceptional growth of over 16 times compared to 2020, likely due to severe restrictions during the pandemic. As markets reopened, the revenue contribution from different regions became more evenly distributed.

Although the Midwest had the highest percentage increase, all regions experienced significant growth, with revenue in the South and Southeast rising by **368%** and **316%**, respectively. The Northeast and West also showed strong performances, growing by **257%** and **151%**.

This indicates that **Adidas‚Äô recovery was not limited to specific regions but rather a broad-based resurgence across the U.S. market**, driven by both increased retailer partnerships and widespread consumer demand.

## **5/. Recommendation**

### **5.1 Product Development Strategy**

Adidas has a diverse customer base across various regions, each contributing significantly to total revenue. Therefore, it is essential for Adidas to develop products that cater to local customer preferences. By analyzing consumer interests, Adidas can create sportswear collections tailored to specific regional tastes.

### **5.2 Online Sales Channel Expansion**

After the COVID-19 pandemic, online shopping has become a habit for consumers. Adidas needs a well-defined strategy to develop this channel effectively. Specifically, Adidas can:
- Leverage its global store network to enhance official website sales and optimize the shopping journey‚Äîfrom ordering to delivery.
- Collaborate with leading e-commerce platforms such as Shopee and TikTok Shop.
- Partner with retailers investing in online expansion, such as SuperSport, to increase digital reach.

### **5.3 Retailer Development Strategy**

Adidas should focus on acquiring new customers and potential retail partners. Additionally, it is crucial to collaborate with underperforming retailers to improve overall business results. At the same time, Adidas should diversify its revenue sources to reduce dependency on any single retailer. This addresses issues like those experienced in 2021:
- Sales in early 2021 were significantly impacted by West Gear, despite stable performance from other retailers.
- Amazon and Walmart showed steady sales growth, while other retailers exhibited high volatility.
- Expanding its retailer network will enable Adidas to maintain stable revenue growth and avoid excessive reliance on specific partners.
